# CPI_prediction

The Tox21 dataset was retrieved from Hirohara, M., Sakakibara, Y.: Convolutional neural network based on SMILES representation of molecules for detecting chemical motif. 
The human CPI dataset was retrieved from Liu et al. (2015).
The base code for the GNN-CNN model was referenecd from theh works of Tsubaki et al. (codebase: https://github.com/masashitsubaki/CPI prediction)

For easier execution of the code, it is recommended to run the colab file: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i9cDVzFF2u2Q8ScTQBkkz6QYiLqlalB2?usp=sharing
